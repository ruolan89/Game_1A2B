# Game_1A2B

The rule of 1A2B(Bulls and cows):

**1. Setup:**

The secret number is typically a four-digit number, with each digit being unique (e.g., 1234 but not 1122).
The guessing player must propose numbers that also consist of four unique digits.

**2. Guessing and Feedback:**

After each guess, feedback is given in the form of "**A**"s and "**B**"s:

An "**A**" (or "bull" in some versions) means that one of the guessed digits is correct and in the correct position.

A "**B**" (or "cow") indicates that a guessed digit is correct but in the wrong position.

For example, if the secret number is **1234** and the guess is **1325**, the feedback would be "**2A1B**":

- "**2A**" for the two numbers (**1** and **3**) being in the correct position.

- "**1B**" for one number (**2**) being correct but in the wrong position.

Number **5** is incorrect and ignored in the feedback.

**3.  Objective:**

The goal is for the guesser to identify the secret number using as few guesses as possible, guided by the feedback from each attempt.
